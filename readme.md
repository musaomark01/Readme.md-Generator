## Description
The ReadMe Generator is a lightweight command-line application designed for generating README files. One of the primary motivations behind creating this application is my role as a continuous learner who works on new projects every week. I believe that this tool can be immensely beneficial not only to individuals like myself but also to those who infrequently engage in README documentation.
